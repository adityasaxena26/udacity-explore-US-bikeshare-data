**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

This project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
